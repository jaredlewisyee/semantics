        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> I've had a lot of hobbies over the years, some that I've been passionate about, and some that just come and go. But one 
            has stuck with me, and that is Basketball. It motivates me to balance my life with things other than just academics, and 
            is my way of escaping reality and relieving stress. Basketball is a way for me to hang out with my friends and grow 
            stronger, a way to practice discipline, and an experience that I want to have each and every day. </p>

        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p> Basketball has been a big part of my life now for a while, something I truly have a passion for and want to pursue further 
            most definitely. It has brought me closer to many of my friends, and helped me gain connections to people who I am quite 
            close with now. Though I started later than most people, it gives me a thrill and feeling like no other. I hope that in 
            the future I grow better as a player and person through it. </p>
